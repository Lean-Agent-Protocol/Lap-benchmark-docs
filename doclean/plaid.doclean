You can further limit the accounts shown in Link by using `account_filters` to specify the account subtypes to be shown in Link. Only the specified subtypes will be shown. This filtering applies to both the Account Select view (if enabled) and the Institution Select view. Institutions that do not support the selected subtypes will be omitted from Link. To indicate that all subtypes should be shown, use the value `"all"`. If the `account_filters` filter is used, any account type for which a filter is not specified will be entirely omitted from Link. For a full list of valid types and subtypes, see the [Account schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#account-type-schema).

If launching Link in update mode, should be omitted; required otherwise.  `balance` is *not* a valid value, the Balance product does not require explicit initialization and will automatically be initialized when any other product is initialized.  The products specified here will determine which institutions will be available to your users in Link. Only institutions that support *all* requested products can be selected; a if a user attempts to select an institution that does not support a listed product, a "Connectivity not supported" error message will appear in Link. To maximize the number of institutions available, initialize Link with the minimal product set required for your use case. Additional products can be added after Link initialization by calling the relevant endpoints. For details and exceptions, see [Choosing when to initialize products](https://plaid.com/docs/link/initializing-products/).  Note that, unless you have opted to disable Instant Match support, institutions that support Instant Match will also be shown in Link if `auth` is specified as a product, even though these institutions do not contain `auth` in their product array.  In Production, you will be billed for each product that you specify when initializing Link. Note that a product cannot be removed from an Item once the Item has been initialized with that product. To stop billing on an Item for subscription-based products, such as Liabilities, Investments, and Transactions, remove the Item via `/item/remove`., redirect_uri: str # A URI indicating the destination where a user should be forwarded after completing the Link flow; used to support OAuth authentication flows when launching Link in the browser or via a webview.
