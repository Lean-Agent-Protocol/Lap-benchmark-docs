When using this token type, `audience` must be the same as the `client_id`. `subject_token` must be a Plaid-issued user token issued from the `/user/create` endpoint. `urn:plaid:params:oauth:user-token` allows exchanging a refresh token for an OAuth token to another `client_id`. The other `client_id` is provided in `audience`. `subject_token` must be an OAuth refresh token issued from the `/oauth/token` endpoint. `urn:plaid:params:credit:multi-user` allows exchanging a Plaid-issued user token for an OAuth token. When using this token type, `audience` may be a client id or a supported CRA partner URN. `audience` supports a comma-delimited list of clients. When multiple clients are specified in the `audience` a multi-party token is created which can be used by all parties in the audience in conjunction with their `client_id` and `client_secret`.}

To request access to additional countries, [file a product access Support ticket](https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/product-and-development/product-troubleshooting/request-product-access) via the Plaid dashboard.

Required for integrations that began using Plaid Protect, Multi-Item Link, or Plaid Check Consumer Report after December 10, 2025. For more details, see [new User APIs](https://plaid.com/docs/api/users/user-apis). One of either the `user_id` or the `user` field is required., products: [str] # List of Plaid product(s) that the linked Item must support. If launching Link in update mode, should be omitted (unless you are using update mode to add a credit product, such as Assets, Statements, Income, or Plaid Check Consumer Report, to an existing Item); at least one `product` is required otherwise.  To maximize the number of institutions and accounts available, initialize Link with the minimal product set required for your use case, as the products specified will limit which institutions and account types will be available to your users in Link. Only institutions that support *all* requested products can be selected; if a user attempts to select an institution that does not support a listed product, a "Connectivity not supported" error message will appear in Link. For each specified product, the Item connected by the user must contain at least one compatible account. For details on compatible product / account type combinations, see [the account type/product support matrix](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#account-type--product-support-matrix).  To add products without limiting the institution list or account types, use the [`optional_products`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-optional-products) or  [`required_if_supported_products`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-required-if-supported-products) fields. Products can also be added to an Item by calling the product endpoint after obtaining an access token; this may require the product to be listed in the [`additional_consented_products`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-additional-consented-products) array. For details, see [Choosing when to initialize products](https://plaid.com/docs/link/initializing-products/).  `balance` is *not* a valid value, the Balance product does not require explicit initialization and will automatically be initialized when any other product is initialized.  If launching Link with CRA products, `cra_base_reports` is required and must be included in the `products` array.  Note that, unless you have opted to disable Instant Match support, institutions that support Instant Match will also be shown in Link if `auth` is specified as a product, even though these institutions do not contain `auth` in their product array.  In Production, you will be billed for each product that you specify when initializing Link. Note that a product cannot be removed from an Item once the Item has been initialized with that product. To stop billing on an Item for subscription-based products, such as Liabilities, Investments, and Transactions, remove the Item via `/item/remove`., required_if_supported_products: [str] # List of Plaid product(s) you wish to use only if the institution and account(s) selected by the user support the product. Institutions that do not support these products will still be shown in Link. The products will only be extracted and billed if the user selects an institution and account type that supports them.  There should be no overlap between this array and the `products`, `optional_products`, or `additional_consented_products` arrays. The `products` array must have at least one product.

There should be no overlap between this array and the `products`, `required_if_supported_products`, or `additional_consented_products` arrays. The `products` array must have at least one product.  For more details on using this feature, see [Optional Products](https://plaid.com/docs/link/initializing-products/#optional-products)., additional_consented_products: [str] # List of additional Plaid product(s) you wish to collect consent for to support your use case. These products will not be billed until you start using them by calling the relevant endpoints.  `balance` is *not* a valid value, the Balance product does not require explicit initialization and will automatically have consent collected.  Institutions that do not support these products will still be shown in Link.  There should be no overlap between this array and the `products` or `required_if_supported_products` arrays.  If you include `signal` in `additional_consented_products`, you will need to call [`/signal/prepare`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/signal/#signalprepare) before calling `/signal/evaluate` for the first time on an Item in order to get the most accurate results. For more details, see [`/signal/prepare`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/signal/#signalprepare)., webhook: str(url) # The destination URL to which any webhooks should be sent. Note that webhooks for Payment Initiation (e-wallet transactions only), Transfer, Bank Transfer (including Auth micro-deposit notification webhooks), Monitor, and Identity Verification are configured via the Dashboard instead.

Note that any redirect URI must also be added to the Allowed redirect URIs list in the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api). If initializing on Android, `android_package_name` must be specified instead and `redirect_uri` should be left blank., android_package_name: str # The name of your app's Android package.

You can further limit the accounts shown in Link by using `account_filters` to specify the account subtypes to be shown in Link. Only the specified subtypes will be shown. This filtering applies to both the Account Select view (if enabled) and the Institution Select view. Institutions that do not support the selected subtypes will be omitted from Link. To indicate that all subtypes should be shown, use the value `"all"`. If the `account_filters` filter is used, any account type for which a filter is not specified will be entirely omitted from Link. For a full list of valid types and subtypes, see the [Account schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#account-type-schema).  The filter may or may not impact the list of accounts shown by the institution in the OAuth account selection flow, depending on the specific institution. If the user selects excluded account subtypes in the OAuth flow, these accounts will not be added to the Item. If the user selects only excluded account subtypes, the link attempt will fail and the user will be prompted to try again., eu_config: map{headless: bool} # Configuration parameters for EU flows, institution_id: str # Used for certain legacy use cases, payment_configuration: map{amount!: str, description: str} # Specifies options for initializing Link for use with the Pay By Bank flow.

It is recommended to send the request 15 minutes prior to the cutoff to ensure that it will be processed in time for submission before the cutoff. If the transfer is processed after this cutoff but before the Standard ACH cutoff, it will be sent over Standard ACH rails and will not incur same-day charges; this will apply to both legs of the transfer if applicable.

It is recommended to send the request 15 minutes prior to the cutoff to ensure that it will be processed in time for submission before the cutoff. If the transfer is processed after this cutoff but before the Standard ACH cutoff, it will be sent over Standard ACH rails and will not incur same-day charges; this will apply to both legs of the transfer if applicable. The transaction limit for a Same Day ACH transfer is $1,000,000. Authorization requests sent with an amount greater than $1,000,000 will fail.  For transfers submitted as `rtp`,  Plaid will automatically route between Real Time Payment rail by TCH or FedNow rails as necessary. If a transfer is submitted as `rtp` and the counterparty account is not eligible for RTP, the `/transfer/authorization/create` request will fail with an `INVALID_FIELD` error code. To pre-check to determine whether a counterparty account can support RTP, call `/transfer/capabilities/get` before calling `/transfer/authorization/create`.  Wire transfers are currently in early availability. To request access to `wire` as a payment network, contact your Account Manager. For transfers submitted as `wire`, the `type` must be `credit`; wire debits are not supported. The cutoff to submit a wire payment is 6:30 PM Eastern Time on a business day; wires submitted after that time will be processed on the next business day. The transaction limit for a wire is $999,999.99. Authorization requests sent with an amount greater than $999,999.99 will fail.}
